        <p>Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems are digital versions of patients' paper charts and have become a cornerstone in modern healthcare for managing patient information. While they offer significant advantages in terms of accessibility, efficiency, and quality of care, they also present considerable security challenges. Ensuring the security of EMR systems is critical to protecting patient privacy, maintaining trust, and complying with legal and regulatory requirements.</p>
